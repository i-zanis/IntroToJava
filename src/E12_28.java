/**(Rename files) Suppose you have a lot of files in a directory named Exercisei_j,
 where i and j are digits. Write a program that pads a 0 before i if i is a single
 digit. For example, a file named Exercise2_1 in a directory will be renamed to
 Exercise02_1. In Java, when you pass the symbol * from the command line,
 it refers to all files in the directory (see Supplement III.V). Use the following
 command to run your program:
 java Exercise12_28 **/
